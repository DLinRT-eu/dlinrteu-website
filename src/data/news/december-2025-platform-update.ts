## 📈 Database Expansion

The DLinRT.eu catalog continues to grow, now featuring **over 64 AI-powered radiotherapy products** from more than **35 companies worldwide** — a significant increase from 64 products and 32 companies in our previous update. This expansion reflects the rapid advancement of AI technologies in radiation oncology and the growing adoption of AI-powered solutions across clinical workflows.

## 🔧 New Product Category: Platform

We are excited to introduce **Platform** as a dedicated product category in our catalog. Platform products represent comprehensive AI-powered systems that integrate multiple capabilities into unified solutions, including:

- **Auto-contouring** for anatomical structure delineation
- **Dose prediction** for treatment planning optimization  
- **Image synthesis** for multi-modal imaging workflows
- **Treatment planning** automation and decision support

Examples of platform products now catalogued include:
- **MVision AI Workspace+** - Comprehensive AI platform for radiotherapy workflows
- **GE Healthcare IRT (Intelligent Radiation Therapy)** - Integrated AI solutions for treatment planning
- **MedLever AI Platform** - Multi-task AI system for radiation oncology

This category recognizes that many AI solutions in radiotherapy are evolving from single-task applications to comprehensive platforms that address multiple clinical needs.

## 🔐 New User Authentication & Roles System

To support our growing community and ensure data integrity, we have launched a **secure, role-based user authentication system** that complies with European GDPR regulations. The platform now supports three distinct user roles:

### **Reviewer Role**
Clinical and scientific experts from the radiotherapy community who validate and review product information to ensure accuracy and clinical relevance. Reviewers have access to:
- Product review dashboards
- Collaborative review workflows
- Assignment management tools

### **Company Representative Role**  
Verified contacts from medical device manufacturers who can certify and update information about their company's products. Company representatives can:
- Certify product accuracy through formal processes
- Request updates to product information
- Track certification status and revision history

### **Administrator Role**
Platform admins oversee the catalog, coordinate review rounds, manage user roles, and maintain system integrity.

All user data is handled in accordance with European data protection regulations, with institutional email verification and secure authentication protocols. Users can register through institutional email addresses, and role assignments are carefully verified to maintain data quality.

## 📋 Upcoming: January 2026 Review Round

We are pleased to announce an **upcoming systematic review round** scheduled to finish at the **end of January 2026**. This comprehensive review will include:

### Review Process
- All listed products will be systematically reviewed by expert reviewers
- Product information will be validated for accuracy and completeness
- Updates will be incorporated based on the latest regulatory and clinical information

### Company Certification Phase
Following the completion of reviews, **company certification requests will be sent to all manufacturers**. This process will:
- Provide manufacturers with the opportunity to verify product information
- Enable direct updates from company representatives
- Establish formal certification status for products
- Create a transparent chain of verification for catalog users

This dual-phase approach ensures both independent expert validation and manufacturer confirmation, strengthening the reliability of our catalog.
