    description: "Accuray® Synchrony® is a real-time motion synchronization technology for target tracking and motion-compensated radiation delivery on the CyberKnife® and Radixact® Systems. It measures target location and motion using kV X-ray imaging and predicts target location from respiratory motion signals, enabling the treatment systems to compensate for motion in real time. Accuray describes Synchrony® as using a patient-specific, treatment-session-specific AI motion model; this represents individualized motion modeling and prediction rather than a population-trained deep-learning model.",

The Radixact Treatment Delivery System is indicated for delivery of radiation therapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery to tumors or other targeted tissues anywhere in the body under the direction of a licensed medical practitioner. The 510(k) summary describes the feature as measuring tumor location and motion using kV images and predicting tumor location based on a respiration-amplitude measurement device, after which Radixact compensates for tumor motion by making real-time adjustments. Synchrony® is also available on CyberKnife® systems under separate CyberKnife® system clearances and clinical history."

    clinicalImpact: "I2",
    evidenceRigorNotes: "Evidence includes phantom/QA validation, commissioning/implementation studies, long-term CyberKnife® Synchrony® clinical accuracy literature, and recent Radixact® clinical cohort reports. Key Radixact® JACMP reference is Ferris et al. 2020 (DOI 10.1002/acm2.12978), which corrects the erroneous citation link introduced in other evaluations. Current Radixact® clinical evidence is growing but still primarily comprised of single-center, retrospective case-series, or case-report level studies rather than large prospective multi-center trial outcomes.",
    clinicalImpactNotes: "Synchrony® enables active real-time compensation for intrafraction targets, supporting margin reduction and improved healthy tissue sparing (clinical toxicity data evaluated in Lo Conte et al. 2025). Frame benefits conservatively due to limited prospective randomized trials.",

    clinicalEvidence: "The clinical and technical utility of Synchrony® has a highly established evidence base on the CyberKnife® System (extending nearly 25 years since 2002) and a growing clinical peer-reviewed record on the Radixact® Treatment Delivery System (since its launch in 2019). Clinical studies demonstrate accurate real-time tracking, low residual latencies (±10 ms), and reduced treatment-margins. Recent clinical studies (Acharya et al. 2025, Okada et al. 2025, Lo Conte et al. 2025) demonstrate feasibility and excellent toxicity outcomes in liver tumor tracking and prostate SBRT.",
