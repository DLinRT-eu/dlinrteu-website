## Evidence Level Classification (Dual-Axis System)

Products are classified using a **dual-axis framework** separating Evidence Rigor (E0-E3) from Clinical Impact (I0-I5), adapted from [van Leeuwen et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-07892-z) and updated with [Antonissen et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-025-11830-8). The Clinical Impact axis is cross-referenced with the [Fryback & Thornbury hierarchy](https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X9101100203).

### Evidence Rigor (E0-E3)

| E0 | No Peer-Reviewed Evidence | Vendor materials, regulatory submissions only |
| E1 | Preliminary Evidence | Single-center, small cohorts, pilot studies |
| E2 | Validated Evidence | Multi-center (3+ sites), large prospective cohorts, external validation |
| E3 | Systematic Evidence | Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, RCTs |

### Clinical Impact (I0-I5)

| Level | Name | F&T Level | When to Use |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| I0 | None Demonstrated | — | Feasibility only, no benefit shown |
| I1 | Quality Assurance | Level 1 | QA tools, monitoring, consistency checks |
| I2 | Workflow | Level 2 | Time savings, variability reduction, dose reduction, image quality improvement |
| I3 | Decision | Level 3 | Changes in treatment management or plan selection |
| I4 | Outcome | Levels 4–5 | Toxicity reduction, survival, patient outcomes |
| I5 | Societal | Level 6 | Cost-effectiveness, access to care |
